## Intro

"Death Journey" is an adventure game that explores the boundaries between life and death, deepening the player's understanding of mortality. Players take on the role of a boy who meets an untimely end, guided by a mysterious force to traverse different time periods and interact with various characters. Through these interactions, the boy gains insight into the diverse perspectives on death.

## Story Line

### Level 0: "Awakening in Shadows"

Leo awakens in a home that feels strangely unfamiliar. The walls echo with an eerie silence. As he approaches a little ghost, it reveals a haunting truth - Leo has passed beyond the realms of the living...

### Level 1: "Whispers of Divinity"

In the ancient Egyptian temple, Neferet, a priestess plagued by doubt, and the boy unlock mysteries beyond mortality. Together, they challenge the boundaries of faith, uncovering secrets that echo through time.

### Level 2: "Eternal Pursuit"

In a futuristic lab, the enigmatic twins Victor and Vincent beckon. One seeks immortality, the other cherishes fleeting moments. The boy's choice will shape their legacy.

### Level 3: "Spotlight's Shadow"

Amidst the dazzling realm of fame, Scarlett Moon's story unfolds. The boy navigates a world of hidden struggles, confronting the price of stardom and the power of personal choices.

### Level 4: "Silicon Souls' Symphony"

In a city ruled by AI, the boy meets ADA, a machine with beliefs. Together, they blur lines between man and machine, uncovering the essence of identity.

### Level 5: "Echoes of Existence"

As souls dance through ephemeral realms, the boy contemplates existence. Within his own vessel, a new spirit thrives. What legacy will he leave in the tapestry of eternity?

## Embracing OOP Design [TBD]

> Detailed examples are coming soon.

Welcome to "Death Journey", an adventure game that not only delves into the complexities of life and death but also embodies the essence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this game, OOP isn't just a concept, it's the very foundation that brings the world to life.

### Object-Oriented World:

In "Death Journey," every element, from characters to environments, is an object. Each object encapsulates its own unique properties and behaviors, following OOP's core tenet of encapsulation. This ensures that the codebase remains organized, modular, and easy to manage.

### Classes and Inheritance:

Much like the diverse characters within the game, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. Inheritance allows for the extension of existing classes, forming hierarchies that represent the relationships between different elements. This design principle promotes code reuse, enabling the creation of rich, varied experiences.

### Polymorphism and Interfaces:

"Death Journey" embraces polymorphism, allowing different objects to exhibit unique behaviors based on their context. Interfaces define contracts that guide the interactions between objects, promoting flexibility and adaptability in gameplay.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction:

Objects in "Death Journey" maintain a level of encapsulation, ensuring that their internal workings remain hidden, allowing for easy maintenance and updates. Abstraction further refines this process, emphasizing what an object does rather than how it does it.

### Design Patterns in Action:

The game employs various design patterns, such as Singleton for critical components and Factory for object creation. These patterns not only enhance the efficiency of the code but also provide a framework for handling complex interactions.

### Events and Interaction:

OOP enables seamless event handling and interaction between objects. When the player engages with the game world, events trigger responses, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

### Scalability and Extensibility:

By adhering to OOP principles, "Death Journey" is designed to be highly scalable. New levels, characters, and features can be seamlessly integrated without disrupting existing systems, ensuring that the game can evolve over time.
