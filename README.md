## Intro

"Beyond the Life" is an adventure game that explores the boundaries between life and death, deepening the player's understanding of mortality. Players take on the role of a boy who meets an untimely end, guided by a mysterious force to traverse different time periods and interact with various characters. Through these interactions, the boy gains insight into the diverse perspectives on death.
