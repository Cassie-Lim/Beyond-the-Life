As you slowly awaken, a sense of dizziness washes over you, almost as if you've been in a deep slumber for ages. Your mind is as heavy as a stone, yet your body feels as weightless as a feather...

Your home is bathed in a soft, unfamiliar light. But what makes it all the more weird is the sight of a peculiar little creature taking a shower right before your eyes...! You can't help but wonder if you've slipped into the world of dreams.
